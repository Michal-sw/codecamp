                <p id="drake-intro">Born in 1976 as the second son of American archeologist, brother of Samuel Drake. In 1981, 5 years after Drakes birth his mother had been suffering from an unknown terminal illness, which led to her suicide. After that, he along with his brother found home in Saint Francis' Boy's Home, a Catholic orphanage. All of their mother's possesions were later sold by their father (who gave them up to the orphanage).
                The two spent the next few years in the orphanage, during which Nathan took interest in books and was taught Latin by the orphanage's nuns, all while learning free-running and climbing from Sam. Eventually, Sam was kicked out of the orphanage due to criminal activities, before taking a job to support both himself and Nathan.
